# Android Countdown Timer
This is a simple, no-frills but efficient timer app for android created based on my personal need.

You can create multiple sequences of countdown timers which can be run once or in a loop.

And the most important feature of this app - Unlike all other timers I have used, it doesn't
throw a tantrum at the end of the countdown. It just beeps twice to inform you and then promptly
shuts-up without you even needing to touch the phone.

### Screen 1: 
*The first screen lists all stored sequences called events*
