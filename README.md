This is as simple but efficient timer app for android created based on my personal need.

You can create multiple sequences of countdown timers which can be run once or in a loop.

Screen 1: The first screen lists all stored sequences called events.

Create new events by clicking + button

Long press each event to get Menu to either edit or delete event

Press event to open screen to run the sequence
 
Screen 2: This screen is used to create new event or edit existing event
  
Click + button to create new timer item
  Long press timer item to open Menu to get delete option
  Press timer item to edit existing timer
  
 Screen 3:
  This screen is used to run created event
  Press start to start timers items one after other in sequence
  After each timer item end there is a tone of 50ms is played twice with a gap of 50ms along with vibration
  The timer item which is active is marked with a red dot
  To stop timer at any time press stop. This resets the timer sequence which can be restarted again.
  To loop sequence repeatedly press repeat button beside start
